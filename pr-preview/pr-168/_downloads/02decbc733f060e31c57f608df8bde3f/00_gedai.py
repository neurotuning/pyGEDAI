Understanding the GEDAI model
=============================

In this first tutorial, we introduce the GEDAI
(Generalized Eigenvalue De-Artifacting Instrument) model. GEDAI is an
unsupervised method for denoising EEG data.

.. note::

    This tutorial focuses on model understanding. For practical workflows,
    continue with tutorials from the ``use`` section (offline templates)
    and the ``advanced`` section (online and forward-model workflows).

# as this allows the model to better capture the noise characteristics of the data.

# GEDAI will automatically apply an average reference before fitting or
# transforming the data.
# If the data was referenced to a different reference during acquisition, it is
# recommended to add the reference channel to the data before using GEDAI. This
# way the rank of the data will be preserved, and you will be able to reference
# the data to another reference after denoising if needed.

# GEDAI
# -----
# ``GEDAI`` uses generalized eigenvalue decomposition to separate brain signals
# from noise based on a leadfield covariance model.
# In this tutorial, we will focus on the default ``GEDAI`` implementation which
# uses broadband EEG data. Please refers to the documentation if you want to learn
# more about the Spectral GEDAI and how to use it for frequency-specific denoising.

gedai = Gedai()

# %%
# Model Fitting
# -------------
# The fitting process estimates the optimal threshold to distinguish between
# signal and noise components. ``GEDAI`` can be fitted on :class:`~mne.io.Raw`
# or :class:`~mne.Epochs` objects.
# If raw data is used, it is internally segmented into epochs before fitting.
# The ``duration`` parameter controls the epoch length, and the ``overlap`` parameter
# controls the overlap between consecutive epochs.

duration = 2.0
overlap = 0.5

# %%
# Since ``GEDAI`` estimates the noise covariance from the data itself,
# we usually want ``bad`` segments (e.g., with large artifacts) and ``bad`` channels
# to be included in the fitting process. Unless you have specific requirements,
# we recommend keeping the default ``reject_by_annotation`` setting.

reject_by_annotation = False  # default

# %%
# The reference covariance defines what good data should look like.
# The default ``leadfield`` option uses a covariance matrix
# based on a generic head model and the standard 10-20 montage.
# It is possible to use a custom reference covariance matrix instead,
# for example, by using the :func:`~gedai.covariance.compute_covariance_from_forward`
# function. This topic is covered in the ``advanced`` section of the tutorials.

reference_cov = "leadfield"

# %%
# .. note::
#
#     If you want to test ``GEDAI`` on data that does not follow the standard 10-20
#     naming convention, you can use the :meth:`mne.io.Raw.interpolate_bads` method to
#     project your data to a standard 10-20 montage before applying ``GEDAI``.

# %%
# To determine the optimal threshold for separating signal and noise components,
# ``GEDAI`` uses the ``SENSAI`` algorithm. ``SENSAI`` is an unsupervised method that
# finds the optimal eigenvalue threshold that maximizes the similarity between
# the cleaned data and the reference covariance while minimizing the similarity
# between the removed data and the reference covariance.
# The ``noise_multiplier`` parameter controls the weight given to noise
# similarity compared to signal similarity.
# Higher values will prioritize keeping more brain signals, potentially at the
# expense of removing less noise.

noise_multiplier = 3.0

# %%
# The optimal threshold can be determined either using continuous bounded scalar
# optimization (``"optimize"``, default) or by evaluating a discrete grid of candidate
# thresholds (``"gridsearch"``).

sensai_method = "optimize"

# %%
# Fit the GEDAI model

fig = gedai.plot_fit()

# %%
# ``SENSAI`` internally uses a custom scaling of the eigenvalues, called
# SENSAI scaling. Higher SENSAI threshold values correspond to more aggressive
# denoising. The ``signal similarity`` (blue curve) indicates how similar the
# cleaned data is to the reference covariance. In our example, we can see that
# initially, as the SENSAI threshold increases, the signal similarity also
# increases, indicating that artifactual components are being removed.
# However, after a certain point, the signal similarity starts to decrease,
# which may indicate that some brain signals are being removed as well.
# Conversely, the ``noise similarity`` (red curve) remains low up to a certain
# SENSAI threshold, indicating that the removed components are dissimilar to
# the reference covariance. However, beyond that point, the noise similarity
# starts to increase, suggesting that brain signals are being removed along
# with noise. The ``SENSAI score`` (black curve) combines both signal and noise
# similarities to provide an overall measure of denoising quality.

# %%
# Transform the Data (Denoising)
# ------------------------------
# Once fitted, the ``GEDAI`` model can be used to remove artifacts and noise
# from the data. The transform operation projects out the noise components
# while preserving the brain signals.

denoised_raw = gedai.transform_raw(raw, overlap=overlap, verbose=False)

# %%
# We can visualize the difference between the original and denoised data using
# an interactive plot. This allows you to inspect individual channels and see
# how ``GEDAI`` has removed artifacts while preserving neural signals.
